# Re-Introduction

For my HarvardX capstone project, I performed an analysis on whether I could predict this year's Most Improved Player and next year's candidates (found here). With the 2019-2020 regular season being restarted in Orlando, I decided to go back and improve on it. Major changes include:

* a more robust dataset (instead of using the IMPORTHTML function on Google Sheets multiple times, I learned how to webscrape)
* a new variable (experience or seasons played in the league)
* different machine learning models (a decision tree does not lend itself to use with this many granular decimals)

# Introduction

As the beginning of a new NBA season nears, predictions start to roll in from pundits. In terms of major player awards, the Most Improved Player is the most "predicted by gut feeling".

* there are usually a select group of players that have a chance at Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year, with minor turnover year-over-year
* Sixth Man of the Year (given to the best performing player that does not start the game on the court) has morphed into a type: the high scoring guard that ironically often places in the top 5 in minutes played on the team
    + a guard has won 13 of the past 15 years, and the winner regardless of position has placed in the top 5 in minutes played on the team 12 of the 15 years
* Rookie of the Year, by definition, has turnover every year, but predictions tend towards players taken near the beginning of the draft

The goal of this analysis is to use machine learning to make a two-fold prediction.

1. Predict the winner of this year's (2021) MIP award.
2. Predict candidates of next year's (2022) MIP award.

On May 25, 2021, Julius Randle was revealed as the 2021 MIP. While disappointed I wasn't able to create a model in time, it'll serve as a good check.

Steps that were performed:

1. loading the data and swapping NA's with 0's
2. visualizing how MIP winners have performed and how much vote share they received
3. create a version of the data that shows statistical jumps (current season minus previous season)
4. separating out evaluation sets (the 2020 season) and test sets (the 1987 season for predicting the 2020 winner, the 1986 and 2019 seasons for predicting 2021 candidates)
5. training five models: a linear baseline, a k-nearest-neighbors model, two separate random forest models and a support vector machine model

Note: to simplify the Season column, I refer to each season by its second half. So you might also hear the current season referred to as the 2020-2021 season.

## Downloading  the Data

This is a dataset that I have compiled from Basketball-Reference. Each player season contains some identifying factors:

* a unique Season ID
* the player's name
* the player's age as of February 1st of that season (per Basketball-Reference recordkeeping)
* the team that the player played for (if they played for multiple teams, it was recorded as TOT)
* the actual season
* the birth year
    + this is to break ties, as there are instances of 2 players having the same name and playing in the same season as well as father and son playing in different eras under the same name
* the number of years of experience the player has accumulated
    + a rookie, or a player with no prior experience, is given the value 1
    + this value is incremented up every subsequent season that a player has played in; if a player is a rookie in the 1990 NBA season, skips the 1991 NBA season and comes back for the 1992 NBA season, his experience value in 1992 is 2, not 3

There are three comma-separated value files of player statistics: 

* Player Per Game contains per game stats
* Per 100 Poss contains stats per 100 possessions
    + this adjusts for pace, which is the number of possessions teams use in 48 minutes (the typical length of a game, excluding overtimes)
    + this is necessary because the late 1990s/early 2000s were notoriously slow, so raw statistics were depressed
* Advanced contains advanced stats
    + for more information, refer to this [*Basketball-Reference glossary*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html)
    
The above three files will be combined into one dataframe with seasons prior to 1984-1985 (which is one season before the inaugural awarding of the MIP award) removed.

```{r load_stats_csvs,results='hide'}
#specify columns because otherwise birth year is read as logical
cols_for_stats=cols(
  .default = col_double(),
  player = col_character(),
  hof = col_logical(),
  pos = col_character(),
  lg = col_character(),
  tm = col_character()
)

advanced=read_csv("Data/Advanced.csv",col_types = cols_for_stats)
per_poss=read_csv("Data/Per 100 Poss.csv",col_types = cols_for_stats)
per_game=read_csv("Data/Player Per Game.csv",col_types = cols_for_stats)
combined=left_join(per_game,per_poss) %>% left_join(.,advanced) %>% filter(season > 1984)
```

The other file that will be loaded is the Player Award Shares comma-separated values file. This file keeps track of both the number of first-place votes and the share of an award that a player received. Share equals the amount of points received divided by the maximum number of points possible. The file has multiple awards so it will be filtered for only MIP results. Up to the 2002 season, MIP voters were given one vote, and the player with the highest number of votes won the award. Starting in 2003, a point system was introduced, where:

* a first-place vote equals five points
* a second-place vote equals three points
* a third-place vote equals one point
* the player with the most ***points*** won the award

Theoretically, it is possible to have the most first-place votes and not win the award, but it has never happened in the history of the award.

```{r load_award_share_csvs,results='hide'}
mip_share=read_csv("Data/Player Award Shares.csv",col_types = cols(
  .default = col_double(),
  award= col_character(),
  player = col_character(),
  pos = col_character(),
  tm = col_character(),
  winner = col_logical() 
)) %>% filter(award=="mip") %>% select(season,seas_id:tm,share)
```

While the MIP share is tracked for the season in which the vote was received, it will also be tracked for the season prior. The latter column will help identify candidates for next season. For example, Pascal Siakam of the Toronto Raptors won the MIP award in 2019 with an MIP vote share of 0.938. This would be recorded in Siakam's 2019 season under `share` and in Siakam's 2018 Season under `share_next_seas`.

```{r add_share_next_seas,results='hide'}
stats_and_share=left_join(combined,mip_share) %>% group_by(player_id) %>% arrange(season) %>%
  mutate(share_next_seas=lead(share)) %>% ungroup()
```

Let's see if there is any missing data.
```{r see_missing}
colSums(is.na(stats_and_share))
```

Looks like there's a significant amount of missing data, but it can be broken down into bite-size parts:

* the NA's in the shooting percentages are due to a lack of attempts
* the consistent 5 NA's in the per-100-possessions and advanced stats are due to a lack of data, as those 5 players played less than a minute of game time
  + the rest of the NA's in per-100-possessions & advanced can also be attributed to a lack of data, but rather than minutes played, it is the absence of the stat itself
* all the players who never received an MIP vote have an NA
* all the players who don't need a birth year to separate them from another player with the same name also have an NA

The above NA's can all be converted to zeroes.

```{r remove_missing}
stats_and_share[is.na(stats_and_share)]<-0
```

```{r clean_environ,echo=FALSE}
rm(advanced,per_game,per_poss,mip_share,combined)
```

## Data Exploration and Visualizations

We'll start by seeing how much vote share MIP award winners have received.
```{r mip_winner_shares, echo=FALSE}
mip_winners<-stats_and_share %>% filter(season!=1987) %>% group_by(season) %>% 
  #get player names and season IDs from indexes
  summarize(player=player[which.max(share)],
            seas_id=seas_id[which.max(share)],
            share=max(share))
dale_ellis<-stats_and_share %>% filter(season==1987,player=="Dale Ellis") %>% select(season,player,seas_id,share)
mip_winners <- bind_rows(mip_winners,dale_ellis) %>% arrange(season)
rm(dale_ellis)
kable(mip_winners[,c(1:2,4)],booktabs=TRUE) %>% kable_styling(position="center")
```

There are three seasons that have a vote share of zero: 1985 (which was the season before the first awarding of the MIP), 2021 (which is the season we are trying to predict for) and 1987.  

There was an MIP award given out in 1987 to Dale Ellis of the Seattle SuperSonics. However, when researching, I could not find any voting records for the season. I'll discuss what I plan to do with this season a little further in the report.

Secondly, we'll plot the scoring per game of the MIP winners. The three missing seasons (1985,1987,2020) have been removed.
```{r mip_ppg, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE,out.width="100%"}
# take out missing seasons
mip_winners <- mip_winners %>% filter (!(season %in% c(1985,2021)))
#remove repeated columns
mip_stats <- left_join(mip_winners,stats_and_share) %>% 
  select(-c(share_next_seas))
ppg_mip <- mip_stats %>%
  #minus in fill so more intense correlates to higher points
  ggplot(aes(x=season,y=pts_per_game,fill=-pts_per_game)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  scale_fill_distiller(palette="YlOrRd")+
  #player label within bar, points per game label above bar
  geom_text(aes(label=player),size=3,angle="90",hjust=1.1,colour="black")+
  geom_text(aes(label=pts_per_game),size=2,vjust=-1,colour="white")+
  dark_theme_gray()+theme(legend.position = "none")
ggsave(filename = "Images/Points Per Game by MIP Winners.png",plot=ppg_mip,
       width=8,height=4.15,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Points Per Game by MIP Winners.png")
```
The lowest points per game average by an MIP is 9.7 (achieved by Isaac Austin in 1997), while the highest is 26.8 (achieved by Tracy McGrady in 2001).

Next, we'll plot the MIP winners by Win Shares per 48 minutes. Win Shares represent how much a player has contributed to his team's wins by comparing his output to a marginal player. Win Shares per 48 Minutes is a rate stat to compare how effective a player was during their time on the court, regardless of the actual minutes played.
```{r mip_ws_per_48, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ws_mip<- mip_stats %>%
  #minus in fill so more intense correlates to higher ws/48
  ggplot(aes(x=season,y=ws_48,fill=-ws_48)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")+
  scale_fill_distiller(palette="YlOrRd")+
  #player label within bar, points per game label above bar
  geom_text(aes(label=player),size=3,angle="90",hjust=1.1,color="black")+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(ws_48,digits=2)),size=2,vjust=-1,color="white")+
  dark_theme_gray()+theme(legend.position = "none")
ggsave(filename = "Images/WS per 48 Mins by MIP Winners.png",plot=ws_mip,
       width=8,height=4.15,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/WS per 48 Mins by MIP Winners.png")
```

The lowest win shares per 48 minutes by an MIP is 0.06 (achieved by Rony Seikaly in 1990), while the highest is 0.22 (achieved by Ryan Anderson in 2012).

Thirdly, we'll plot the experience of the winners.
```{r mip_experience,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
experience_over_time <- mip_stats %>% 
  ggplot(aes(season,experience))+geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  dark_theme_gray()+theme(legend.position = "none")
ggsave(filename = "Images/Experience of MIP Winners.png",plot=experience_over_time,
       width=8,height=4.15,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Experience of MIP Winners.png")
```
In the first few years of awards, second-year players ruled the roost, winning 4 of the first 5 awards. Recently, the trend has been to recognize a player in their third or fourth season.

Finally, we'll plot how the max voting share has evolved over the life of the award, placing a vertical line at the 2003 season when the voting system changed.
```{r mip_share, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
befo_2003_avg<-mip_stats %>% filter (season<2003 & season != 1987) %>% 
  summarize(mean(share))
after_2003_avg<-mip_stats %>% filter (season>=2003) %>% 
  summarize(mean(share))
share_over_time <- mip_stats %>% 
  ggplot(aes(season,share))+geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2003,color="red",linetype="dotdash")+
  annotate("text",x=1990,y=0.75,
           label=paste("Mean before 2003: \n",
                       round(befo_2003_avg, digits = 3)))+
  annotate("text",x=2010,y=0.875,
           label=paste("Mean after 2003: \n",
                       round(after_2003_avg, digits = 3)))+
  dark_theme_gray()+theme(legend.position = "none")
ggsave(filename = "Images/Vote Share of MIP Winners.png",plot=share_over_time,
       width=8,height=4.15,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Vote Share of MIP Winners.png")
```

Looks like the average jumps up significantly after the voting system was changed. In recent years, there's been more consensus.
